# vxTwitter
(A fork of TwitFix)
Basic flask server that serves fixed twitter video embeds to desktop discord by using either the Twitter API or Youtube-DL to grab tweet video information. This also automatically embeds the first link in the text of non video tweets (API Only)

## Differences from fxtwitter
fxtwitter exposed all recently processed tweets publicly via a "latest" and "top" page.

Even though Tweets are public, it was a personal concern for me that a tweet with potentially sensitive information in it could suddenly be shown to however many people were browsing the latest tweets page, and could be used as a tool for harassment. This was removed in [The following commit](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix/commit/87ba86ba502e73ddb370bd4e5b964548d3272400#diff-a11c36d9b2d53672d6b3d781dca5bef9129159947de66bc3ffaec5fab389d80cL115)

Additionally, vxTwitter has a 'none' cache option, which is intended to be used behind a service like CloudFlare. vxtwitter.com currently runs with this option enabled to protect user privacy. 
## How to use the hosted version

Just replace twitter.com with vxtwitter.com on the link to the tweet! `https://twitter.com/jack/status/20` -> `https://vxtwitter.com/jack/status/20`

## API
If you're a nerd like me and want to use information about a tweet in your code, you can make a request to `api.vxtwitter.com` to get basic information about a tweet:
`https://api.vxtwitter.com/Twitter/status/1263145271946551300`
```json
{
    "date": "Wed May 20 16:31:15 +0000 2020",
    "date_epoch": 1589992275,
    "hashtags": [],
    "likes": 60038,
    "mediaURLs": [

    ],
    "replies": 11720,
    "retweets": 16729,

**Note**: If you enjoy this service, please considering donating via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/dylanpdx) to help cover server costs

I do not monitor any tweets processed by this server. Additionally, if you plan on hosting the code yourself and are concerned about this, be sure to check how to disable logging on the web server you are using (i.e Nginx)

## How to host
See [the following page](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix/blob/main/hosting.md)

## Config

vxTwitter generates a config.json in its root directory the first time you run it, the options are:

**API** - This will be where you put the credentials for your twitter API if you use this method

**database** - This is where you put the URL to your mongoDB database if you are using one

**link_cache** - (Options: **db**, **json**)

- **db**: Caches all links to a mongoDB database. This should be used if you are using uWSGI and are not just running the script on its own as one worker
- **json**: This saves cached links to a local **links.json** file
- **dynamodb**: Saves cached links to a DynamoDB database - set `table` to the table name to cache links to.
- **none**: Does not cache requests. Not reccomended as you can easily use up your Twitter API credits with this. Intended for use with another cache system (i.e NGINX uwsgi_cache)

**color** - Accepts a hex formatted color code, can change the embed color

**appname** - Can change the app name easily wherever it's shown

**repo** - used to change the repo url that some links redirect to

**url** - used to tell the user where to look for the oembed endpoint, make sure to set this to your public facing url

**combination_method** - using c.vxtwitter as the url causes vxTwitter to combine all images in the post into one. This is CPU intensive, so you might not want it running on the same machine that's serving requests. When `combination_method` is set to `local`, it will use the local machine to combine the images. This requires pillow to be installed. If you want to use another server, replace `local` with the URL to the endpoint which combines images. Both methods use the code in the `combineImg` module. Inside, there's also a `Dockerfile` intended to be deployed as a combination endpoint on an [AWS Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html).

## Other stuff

We check for t.co links in non video tweets, and if one is found, we direct the discord useragent to embed that link directly, this means that twitter links containing youtube / vimeo links will automatically embed those as if you had just directly linked to that content
